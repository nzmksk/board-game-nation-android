/**
 * Draws a [ShareCard] as a picture, at the proportions a phone shows full-screen.
 *
 * ### Why a canvas and not a composable
 *
 * The card is never on screen. Rendering a composable to a bitmap means attaching it to
 * a window and waiting for a frame, which drags in a lifecycle the ViewModel does not
 * have and produces something whose size depends on the device it was drawn on. Drawing
 * straight onto a fixed 1080x1920 bitmap is a pure function of the card instead: the
 * same play produces the same image on every phone, off the main thread, with no view
 * tree involved.
 *
 * ### Why it ignores the app's theme
 *
 * Everything else in the app follows the wallpaper through dynamic colour. This does
 * not, and neither does it follow light or dark mode. The image outlives the device it
 * was made on -- it lands in a group chat, on a story, in somebody's camera roll -- so
 * its colours are the app's own and fixed. A card whose look depended on the sender's
 * phone would make the same result arrive looking like a different app each time.
 *
 * Sizes are raw pixels rather than dp for the same reason: the canvas is a constant, so
 * a density would only move the layout around for no gain.
