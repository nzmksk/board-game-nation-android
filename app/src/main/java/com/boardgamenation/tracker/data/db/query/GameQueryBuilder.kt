/**
 * Assembles the collection list query.
 *
 * Play count, last-played date, rating and cost-per-play are all derived in SQL rather
 * than in Kotlin, because the list sorts by them: computing them in memory would mean
 * loading the whole collection to sort it, which is exactly what the 500-game/5000-session
 * performance target rules out.
 *
 * Cost per play divides what the game cost, accessories included, which is why it reads
 * `game_costing` and not the price column. Sorting by price still sorts by price: that
 * option says what it does, and the box is a thing somebody may well want to rank by on
 * its own.
 *
 * Values are always bound as arguments, never interpolated. The only text ever
 * concatenated into the SQL comes from this file's own constants.
